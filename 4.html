<p>The Rolls-Royce Wraith is a Full-size luxury car/ Grand tourer manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and based on the chassis of the Rolls-Royce Ghost. The Wraith shares its name with the 1938 model by the original Rolls Royce company. The body style is a two-door pillar-less coupe with iconic suicide doors, where all side windows can roll down like in a convertible. This body style was popular in American cars during the 1950s and 60s and was known as the hardtop body style, not used by Rolls Royce since 1955.</p>
